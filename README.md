# C Projects -- From Zero to Hero

Welcome to the **C Projects From Zero to Hero** repository! This repo
guides you step-by-step through the C programming language, starting
from the absolute basics and gradually moving into more advanced
concepts through practical, hands-on projects.

Whether you're just beginning your C journey or strengthening your
skills, this structured collection will help you grow from **zero →
hero**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

    repo/
        project0/
        project1/
        project2/
        project3/
        ...

Each project folder includes:

-   Source code (`.c` files)
-   Header files (`.h` files)
-   A short README describing the goal
-   Instructions on how to compile and run
-   A list of concepts covered

Projects increase in difficulty as you progress.

## 🧠 What You Will Learn

Through these projects, you will build up knowledge in:

-   Basic syntax & structure
-   Variables, data types, operators
-   Conditional statements & loops
-   Functions and modular programming
-   Arrays, strings, pointers
-   Dynamic memory allocation
-   Structs & custom data types
-   File I/O
-   Simple algorithms & data structures
-   More advanced topics later on

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  Start with **project0(Project_name)**.
2.  Read its README first.
3.  Try solving the tasks before checking the sample solution.
4.  Move on to the next project once you're confident.
5.  Practice by modifying and experimenting with the code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠 Requirements

To run the projects, you need:

-   A C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MinGW)
-   A terminal/command prompt
-   Basic command-line usage

Example compile command:

    gcc main.c -o output
    ./output
